# Fundamentals of Statistics
Notes on Fundamentals of Statistics course.

## How to use

The `notes.html` file contains the notes in HTML format. Simply download that file to have the notes.

The `Notes.md` file is the source file exporting the HTML file.

The other files are various files I wrote and used while I was following the course.

## How to read the source

To properly use the source code, you need the *Visual Studio Code* text editor with the [*Markdown+Math*](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=goessner.mdmath) extension.

There is currently a bug in that extension that prevents a correct rendering of a couple LaTeX symbols when exporting in HTML; I made [a fork of the extension](https://github.com/skasch/mdmath) that fixes that bug. However, the preview within VSCode still works properly.
